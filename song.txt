I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time

When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain

How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
(Yeah, yeah) 'cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can
