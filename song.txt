I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time

When you leave, I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two, three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain

How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
(Yeah, yeah) 'cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love can do what no one else can

Got me hoping you'll save me right now (hey)
Looking so crazy, your love's (hey)
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love
I'm looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love (I'm warmed up now, let's go)
